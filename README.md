This repository represents my understanding and practical implementation of various classification methods in machine learning. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in applying binary and multiclass classification techniques, performance evaluation, and leveraging both traditional and deep learning methods.

The code is inspired by and builds upon concepts from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron. It is a practical exploration of theoretical concepts brought to life through coding.
